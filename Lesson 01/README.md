## C++ Overview

** C++ ** is a powerful and versatile language that evolved from C. Developed by * Bjarne Stroustrup * in the early 1980s, it is known for its object-oriented features and is widely used in system programming, game development, and complex applications. This guide covers everything from basic syntax to advanced features like templates and exception handling, with clear explanations and code examples.

## Basic Structure

** C++ ** program is made up of one or more functions, starting with the `main()` function. The typical structure of a ** C++ ** program includes:

- ** Header Files **: Include statements for standard library functions and classes.
- ** Namespace Declaration **: Using `namespace std;` to avoid prefixing with `std::`.
- ** Function Definitions **: Including the `main()` function where execution starts.
- ** Statements and Expressions **: To perform operations and computations.
