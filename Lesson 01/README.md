## C++ Overview

**C++** is a highly efficient and flexible language that originated from **C**, developed by `Bjarne Stroustrup` in the early 1980s. It stands out for its object-oriented features and is extensively used in system programming, game development, and complex software applications. This guide provides comprehensive coverage, from basic syntax to advanced topics like templates and exception handling, featuring clear explanations and practical code examples.

## Basic Structure

**C++** program is made up of one or more functions, starting with the `main()` function. The typical structure of a **C++** program includes:

- **Header Files**: Include statements for standard library functions and classes.
- **Namespace Declaration**: Using `namespace std;` to avoid prefixing with `std::`.
- **Function Definitions**: Including the `main()` function where execution starts.
- **Statements and Expressions**: To perform operations and computations.
